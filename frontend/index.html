            The pancreas creates insulin; insulin monitors how much glucose is within the blood.
        </p>
        <ul class="key-points">
            <li>Cells can absorb glucose and use it to function and work.</li>
            <li>When the body does not create an appropriate amount of insulin, glucose stays in the blood and is not used.</li>
            <li>Glucose in the blood could lead to long-term health conditions, such as Diabetes.</li>
            <li>In Type 2 diabetes, cells within the body begin to withdraw from the use of insulin.</li>
            <li>The pancreas would try to create more insulin, but the pancreas may not be able to develop enough to keep up with rising glucose levels.</li>

        <p>
            In Hispanic and Latino communities, Diabetes tends to have more impact in these populations.
        </p>
        <ul class="key-points">
            <li>Hispanic adults, compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts, have a 70% chance of being diagnosed with Diabetes.</li>
            <li>Various factors are significant, such as genomic components, socioeconomic class, and inadequate healthcare (CDC, Office of Minority Health).</li>
            <li>The prevalence of Diabetes in Hispanic communities is higher than in many other demographic groups, with variations across subgroups.</li>
            <li>For instance, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans have some of the highest rates, whereas Cuban Americans show lower prevalence rates.</li>
            <li>These differences may stem from diverse genetic factors, cultural dietary practices, and levels of healthcare accessibility within subgroups (American Diabetes Association, CDC).</li>
            <li>Hispanic populations with certain genomic factors may become prone to an ineffective use of insulin.</li>
            <li>Without a proper regulatory system of insulin, individuals would be more susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Traditional diets rich in carbohydrates and fats, combined with lower physical activity, increase risk.</li>
            <li>Economic limitations can make it difficult to access healthy food options.</li>

        <p>
            Poverty rates create an obstacle to affording proper healthcare.
        </p>
        <ul class="key-points">
            <li>A lack of awareness and education regarding Diabetes may lead to significant complications (Office of Minority Health, CDC).</li>
            <li>Limited health literacy in these communities can impede self-management, as Diabetes requires ongoing lifestyle changes and regular monitoring (American Diabetes Association, Office of Minority Health).</li>
            <li>Diabetes significantly reduces life expectancy and quality of life due to complications such as neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure.</li>
            <li>The economic burden of Diabetes is also substantial for Hispanic families, who face high out-of-pocket costs for medications, treatments, and hospitalizations (CDC, Office of Minority Health).</li>
            <li>Without proper management, high blood sugar over time can cause complications like heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve damage.</li>
